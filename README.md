# NNs from scratch

This repository contains implementations of Neural Networks (NNs) built from scratch for practice purposes. The goal is to deepen understanding of neural network architectures and algorithms by implementing them using only basic programming constructs and mathematical operations. By building neural networks from the ground up, we aim to gain insights into their inner workings and fundamental principles.
